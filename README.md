# iOS_WIN2

Most of the modules in this repo should work fine for any Windows operating system 
configuations or hardware so long as basic GPU drivers are installed.  

Most of the code up until this time period does not function under emulation for Apple machines.  

So far as I remember, it should all work fine under WINE emulation for Linux.(tested around 2010)
